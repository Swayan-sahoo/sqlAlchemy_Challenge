## Climate Analysis and Flask API

This repository contains a project to analyze climate data and develop a Flask API to serve the results of the analysis. The project is divided into two parts:

Climate Data Analysis and Exploration

Design and Implementation of a Flask API

# Part 1: Climate Data Analysis and Exploration

# Overview

Using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we analyze climate data stored in an SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite) to extract meaningful insights, such as precipitation trends and temperature statistics. The analysis includes:

Precipitation Analysis: Explore the last 12 months of precipitation data.

Station Analysis: Identify the most active weather station and analyze its temperature observations.

# Tools Used

SQLAlchemy: For database connection and ORM queries.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For visualizing the data.

Steps

Connect to the SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

Reflect the database tables into Python classes.

Perform precipitation analysis:

Extract the last 12 months of precipitation data.

Visualize precipitation data using a bar chart.

Calculate summary statistics for the precipitation data.

Perform station analysis:

Calculate the total number of stations.

Identify the most active station (highest number of observations).

Analyze temperature data for the most active station.

Plot a histogram of temperature observations for the last 12 months.

# Output

A bar chart showing precipitation trends over the last year.

A histogram of temperature observations for the most active station.

Summary statistics for precipitation and temperature data.

# Part 2: Flask API Development

# Overview

A Flask application is developed to serve climate analysis results through a RESTful API. The API provides endpoints for querying precipitation, station, and temperature data.

Tools Used

Flask: For API development.

SQLAlchemy: For database queries.

JSONify: To return API responses in JSON format.

API Endpoints

/ (Homepage): Lists all available routes.

/api/v1.0/precipitation: Returns the last 12 months of precipitation data in JSON format, with dates as keys and precipitation values as values.

/api/v1.0/stations: Returns a JSON list of all weather stations.

/api/v1.0/tobs: Returns a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the last 12 months for the most active station.

/api/v1.0/<start>: Returns the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for all dates from the given start date.

/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>: Returns the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures for dates within the specified start-end range.

# Usage

Start the Flask app:

python app.py

Access the API through the listed routes.

Example Output

Precipitation Endpoint (/api/v1.0/precipitation):

{
    "2016-08-23": 0.00,
    "2016-08-24": 0.08,
    ...
}
